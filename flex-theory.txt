flex: 1; 
gives each box the ability to grow if necessary, so they share the container space equally. 
It's shorthand for 
flex-grow: 1; 
flex-shrink: 1; 
flex-basis: 0%;.
min-width: 200px; 
ensures that the boxes don't shrink below a certain width, preserving the design integrity.


Responsiveness with Media Queries
Media queries adjust the flex container's and items' properties based on the viewport size, enhancing the layout's responsiveness.

For screens between 991px and 768px:

justify-content: space-between; ensures that the boxes are distributed with space between them, fully utilizing the container's width.
flex-basis: calc(50% - 20px); 
adjusts each box's base size to fit two per row, accounting for the gap.
For screens narrower than 767px:

flex-direction: column; 
changes the layout direction to vertical, stacking the flex items.
flex-basis: 100%; 
makes each box take up the full container width, facilitating a single-column layout.
