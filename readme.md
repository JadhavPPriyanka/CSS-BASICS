# Flexbox
The layout is based on a flex container (the parent element) and flex items (the children).

# Box model
width: Specifies the width of the content area.
height: Specifies the height of the content area.
padding: Adds space between the content and the border.
border: Defines the border around the content.
margin: Sets the space outside the border, affecting the layout of neighboring elements.

# Specificity
If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element..


# Typography:
Typography is all about how text looks and feels when it's written or displayed. It's like making sure that the words you read are easy to understand and look good. It includes things like:

Font Properties: CSS offers various font properties to control the appearance of text, including font-family, font-size, font-weight, font-style, and font-variant.
Text Properties: CSS properties like color, text-align, line-height, and text-decoration help style and format text content.
Font Stacks: Utilizing font stacks allows specifying a list of font families, providing fallback options in case the preferred font is unavailable.
Web Fonts: CSS @font-face rule enables using custom fonts from external sources, expanding the range of typefaces available to designers.
